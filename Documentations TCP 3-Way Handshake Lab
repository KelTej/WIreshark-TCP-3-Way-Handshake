*Analyzing A TCP 3-Way Handshake Using Wireshark*

OBJECTIVE:
  - Understanding and identifying each step of a TCP 3-Way handshake using Wireshark packet capture. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to analyze network traffic and recognize connection initiation patterns.

TOOLS USED:
  - Wireshark
  - Microsoft Edge for generating traffic

METHOD:
  1. Launched Wireshark and began capturing the Wifi traffic
  2. Applied a TCP filter to the filter section and identified the port
  3. Filtered the capture by using tcp.port ==(port number)
  4. Identified the hand shake sequence 
    -SYN
    -SYN,ACK
    -ACK
  5. Captured screenshots and redacted any personal information

FINDINGS:
  -SYN Packet 
    *Source --> Destination
    *Flags: SYN
    *Purpose: Client Request to start connection

  -SYN/ACK Packet
    *Destination --> Source
    *Flags: SYN,ACK
    *Purpose: Server acknowledges the request

  -ACK Packet
    *Client --> Server
    *Flags: ACK
    *Purpose: Final handshake, which establishes the connection

ANALYSIS:
  -The handshake confirms how  TCP establishes a connection between the client and the server. The incrementing sequence and acknowledgement numbers indicate synchronization. There were not retransmissions or anomalies  present which indicate a normal handshake.

SUMMARIZED SKILL:
- Completed an analysis of a TCP 3-way handshake through the use of Wireshark. Demonstrated an understanding of network protocol and data sanitization.
